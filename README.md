<p>halebradley.com is a personal portfolio website to show off my projects, hobbies, and anything that makes me, me! The project was built using react and tailwind. Since this was my first &quot;actual&quot; web dev project, I learned a lot about how to plan for a webpage build, how to execute that plan, and how to look back at your work for improvements and overhauls for future iterations. I plan to add a game view of my portfolio to the site and add more relevant personal content to the page over time. </p>
